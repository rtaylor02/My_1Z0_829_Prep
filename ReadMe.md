## 1. Github Repository /  GitHub Templates

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What is a GitHub repository?

  A repository is a place where your git **project** and its **files** resides. Typical repository stores source code along with `.git` folder - a directory which tracks snapshot of changes introduced to your files.

  #### Why to use GitHub repository?

  GitHub repository is:
  - A place for documenting your project - **GitHub Wiki**
  - A place for automatizing tasks within software development life cycle - **GitHub Actions**
  - A place for organizing and tracking work items - **GitHub Projects**
  - A forum for sharing and raising questions - **GitHub Issues**
  - A place for security scanning - **GitHub Security**
  - And many more ...

  #### What is a GitHub template?

  A GitHub Template is a way of marking your repository as a reusable blueprint. GitHub Template allows to generate new repositories that will preserve the same structure, branches and files as the blueprint repository.

</details>

Let's create our first GitHub repository. This repository will hold `Hello world!` Flask application, and will become our GitHub template for a microservice that we'll build in the next step.

1. On the [GitHub](https://github.com/) page click [New](https://github.com/new) button.

    ![New Repository](assets/img/git/btn_new.png)

1. Fill Repository information and click the `Create repository` button.

    ![Repository](assets/img/git/new_repo.png)

1. What's left is to create a Flask application. If you are not familiar with Flask, read the [quick start](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/) guide. In GitHub's interface by clicking the `Add file` button and selecting `Create new file`.

    [![File Navigation](assets/img/git/file_navigation_add_file.png)](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-init-mini)

    **/app/requirements.txt**

    ```
    coverage==6.5.0
    Flask==2.2.2
    pytest==7.2.0
    ```
    **app/test_app.py**

    ```python
    import pytest

    from run import app as application


    @pytest.fixture()
    def app():
        application.config.update({
            "TESTING": True,
        })
        yield application


    @pytest.fixture
    def client(app):   
        return app.test_client()


    @pytest.fixture()
    def runner(app):
        return app.test_cli_runner()


    def test_api(client):
        response = client.get("/")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert b"Flask" in response.data
    ```

    **app/run.py**

    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)


    @app.route("/")
    def hello_world():
        return "Hello, Flask!"
    ```

    **Dockerfile**

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9.5-alpine

    # Setup environment variables
    ENV PORT=8080 \
        HOST=0.0.0.0 \
        FLASK_APP=/app/run.py \
        PYTHONUNBUFFERED=True
    ARG FLASK_DEBUG=False
    ENV FLASK_DEBUG=$FLASK_DEBUG

    # Setup file system
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY app/ /app

    # Upgrade pip & install python packages
    RUN pip install --upgrade pip --requirement /app/requirements.txt

    # Indicate which port to expose
    EXPOSE $PORT

    # Start app server
    CMD flask run --host=$HOST --port=$PORT
    ```

    **README.md**
    ~~~
    # flask-init-mini

    This project is a boilerplate for future Flask applications.

    Below steps can be executed on any unix like system. I will use ubuntu deployed on
    [O'Reilly's sandbox](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/ubuntu-sandbox/9781492062837) (alternatively you could use [Katacoda's playground](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/ubuntu/playground2004)). Once the sandbox/playground is ready, execute instructions specified in below sections.

    ## Setup SSH key

    **This step is option and can be omitted.**

    Create ssh key and add it to GitHub's [SSH keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) settings.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    ## Installation

    ```bash
    # Cloning the source code
    git clone https://github.com/ldynia/flask-init-mini.git
    cd flask-init-mini

    # Building and running docker container
    docker build --tag flask-mini --build-arg FLASK_DEBUG=True .
    docker run --detach --name flask-app --publish 80:8080 --rm flask-mini
    docker ps
    ```
    ## API

    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost"
    ```

    ## Testing

    Unit test
    ```bash
    docker exec flask-app pytest
    ```

    Code coverage
    ```bash
    docker exec flask-app coverage run -m pytest
    docker exec flask-app coverage report
    ```
    
    Stop container
    ```bash
    docker stop flask-app
    ```
    ~~~

1. Let's mark repository to a template by clicking repository `Settings` tab, and selecting `Template repository` checkbox.

    [![Settings](assets/img/git/tabs_settings.png)](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-init-mini/settings)

    [![Template repository](assets/img/git/checkbox_template.png)](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-init-mini/settings)

## 2. Microservice

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What is  microservice and why to use them?

  Microservices/Microservice Architecture - is an **architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services** that are:
  - Loosely coupled.
  - Independently deployable.
  - Organized around business capabilities.
  - Highly maintainable and testable.
  - Owned by a small team.

  #### What are typical features of microservice?

  A typical microservice exposes following features:
  - Is structured around business boundaries / [bounded context](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/06/bounded-context-eric-evans/)
  - Has independent database.
  - Communicates over the network.
  - Has well defined API.

</details>

1. Create [New Repository](https://github.com/new) and fill it in according to values listed on the image. Notice that this time we choose **flask-init-mini** project from `Repository template` as a base for our microservice.
    ![New Repository](assets/img/git/new_repo_from_template.png)

1. Click the [**Add File**](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-init-mini) button and add/update blow files.

## 3. GitHub Issues

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What are GitHub Issues?

  GitHub Issues is a tool for keeping track of tasks, bugs and feedback for your project.

  #### Why to use GitHub Issues?

  It's just a convenient way to manage all affairs related to your project.

</details>

1. In repository tabs click [Issues](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock/issues). Next, click the [New issue](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock2/issues/new) button. Fill the form with text specified on the image below, then click the `Submit new issue` button.

## 4. GitHub Releases / Tags

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  It's very seldom that your software will be released only in one version, e.g. `v1.0.0`. As your project grows, you will have a bug to fix and feature to add. GitHub Releases allows you to create tagged artifacts of your software.

</details>

1. In your repository click [tags](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock/tags) icon.

    [![Tags](assets/img/git/file_navigation_tags.png)](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock/tags)

1. Click the `Releases` tab, next click `Create a new release` button, fill it with information specified on the picture below. Once done click the `Publish release` button.

## 5. GitHub Actions

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What is GitHub Actions?

  GitHub Actions is a tool that allows you to automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, which means that commands that you want to execute run after occurrence of a specified event.

  #### Why to use GitHub Actions?

  GitHub Actions allows you to adopt backbone of DevOps methodology such CI/CD.

  #### Explenation

  - **Continuous Integration** goal is to enable automated way to build, package, and test applications.
  - **Continuous Delivery** goal is to automate the delivery of applications to given environment (test or production) via manual release.
  - **Continuous Deployment** goal is to automated release of code to a production environment.

  #### Books

## 6. GitHub Pull Request

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What is a Pull Request?

  A pull request (PR) is a feature of a git hosting service that allows to create a contribution to the repository. PRs allow the maintainer of a repository to review, ask for comments, edit or even discard submitted work. I like to think of a PR as a tangible unit of work in a collaborative world of code.

</details>

1. Fork repository by going to [https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock) and click `Fork` button. Next, in your fork create a new branch called  **db/update**

    ![Fork](./assets/img/git/fork.png)
    ![Fork](./assets/img/git/new_branch.png)

## 8. GitHub Pages

<details>
  <summary>Context</summary>

  #### What is GitHub Pages?

  GitHub Pages is a hosting service for static sites. GitHub Pages serves any static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that you push to repository. You can create your own static files or use a static site generator such [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to build your site for you.

  #### Why to use GitHub Pages?

  The short answer is for **branding** and **promotion**. You can use it for blogging, or as a journal of your work. You can promote yourself with `my_username.github.io` or your project `my_username.github.io/my_project`. Moreover, you have option to brand your work with a custom domain.

</details>

1. In repository settings [Settings](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock/settings) locate [Pages](https://github.com/ldynia/flask-sherlock/settings/pages) tab. Set `Source` to the **main** branch and `directory` to **/docs** and click the`Save` button.
